# UMG-Internship
A project exploring the role of YouTube music videos in streaming on Spotify.

## Summary
For half-year I worked as a data scientist intern in Hilversum at Universal Music Group (UMG), the world’s leading label in merchandising, recording, publishing, and promoting the music of various artists.
When a song is released on Spotify, usually a large budget is allocated to producing a YouTube music video with the goal to increase engagement with the song. Financially, the investment is only relevant if music videos generate revenue by stimulating streaming. Therefore, UMG’s goal is to develop cost-control measures to aid decision-making on whether a music video would be profitable.  
This project explores the role of music videos (YouTube) on streaming (Spotify). First, we investigated whether an increase in streams can be predicted by video engagement. This was followed by exploring other factors, such as artists’ popularity, audience demographics, and time elapsed between song and video release.
During this process, I applied previously acquired skills such as RStudio while also developing new ones like SQL. My responsibilities included: brainstorming business and statistical deliverables with supervisors, data extraction and transformation, model fitting, and result interpretation. 
Findings indicated that video engagement did not predict an increase in streams. Conclusively, the company may reconsider large investments in music videos. I discuss the main analysis and subsequent analyses, followed by further exploration of the results and practical implications, such as limited resource availability and validity of predictor variables. Future research should acknowledge the high variability of music data, consider more robust non-parametric models, as well as investigate case studies. 

## Project Description
_General Outline_

The primary aim of this project is to investigate the role of music video engagement in streaming. The hypothesis is that higher video engagement leads to increased streaming, with the increase in streaming rate quantified as the positive difference between the average streaming rate after and before video release. Specifically, we calculated average streams across seven days before and after the video release. On the other hand, we quantified video engagement as the proportion of likes and shares relative to total video views. 

The secondary goal of this project is to examine the role, importance, and explanatory value of each of the variables used to predict the difference in streaming before and after the video release. This was done by investigating different aspects of both video (YouTube) and track (Spotify) data.
